<!-- Goal -->
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
This project focuses on improving plant disease detection through enhanced image preprocessing techniques. 
Instead of building a new disease classification model, the goal is to test whether applying computer vision methods—such as color space transformation, 
noise reduction, edge enhancement, and histogram equalization—can improve the accuracy of existing deep learning models. The team will analyze how different 
preprocessing approaches affect the model’s ability to recognize leaf disease patterns. By comparing results before and after applying these techniques, 
the project aims to show how proper preprocessing can lead to better computer vision performance and more reliable plant disease detection.

<!-- Introduction -->
<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>
The Plant Disease Detection project aims to build upon existing plant disease  detection systems by exploring and implementing computer vision 
techniques to improve accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Previous work in this area has successfully demonstrated the use of CNNs to 
classify plant diseases from leaf images. However, challenges such as variations in lighting, background noise, image quality, and class 
imbalance still limit real-world performance.
</p>

<p>
The goal of this project is to evaluate and enhance existing models through improved preprocessing, feature extraction, and model optimization 
techniques. Specifically, we will apply and compare methods such as image segmentation, data augmentation, edge detection, color space transformation, 
and feature enhancement filters to determine which approaches lead to the most accurate and reliable disease classification results.
</p>

<!-- Approach -->
<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>
  The team will build on an existing plant disease detection model that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
  for image classification. Instead of creating a new model, the focus will be on improving how the images are 
  preprocessed before training.
</p>
<p>
  Two training pipelines will be used: one with raw images as the baseline, and another with images processed
   using computer vision techniques such as color space transformation, Gaussian blur, Sobel and Laplacian 
   edge detection, and histogram equalization. The same CNN architecture will be used for both to ensure a fair
    comparison.
</p>
<p>
  The goal is to find out which preprocessing steps improve the model's accuracy and reliability. 
  The main challenge will be adjusting these methods to enhance disease features without distorting the image.
  Visualization tools like Grad-CAM will be used to confirm whether preprocessing helps the model focus on 
  the correct diseased areas.
</p>
<br><br>

<!-- Plans -->
<h3>Plans for Experimantation</h3>
<p>
The team will begin the project by collecting or selecting an existing dataset that contains various plant leaf images, 
including both healthy and diseased samples. The main focus will not be on building a new dataset but on improving how images 
are prepared before being used for training and testing. The experiments will compare the performance of a standard deep learning model when trained 
on raw images versus images processed with different computer vision techniques.

<ol>
  <li><strong>Image Preprocessing:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Color space transformations to test how color representation affects feature visibility.
      </li>
      <li>
        Noise reduction using Gaussian blur or median filtering.
      </li>
      <li>
        Histogram equalization to enhance contrast and make disease spots more visible
      </li>
      <li>
        Edge enhancement using filters like Sobel or Laplacian operators.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Feature Extraction:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The processed images will be fed into a pre-trained deep learning model (such as a CNN) to measure how preprocessing affects accuracy and generalization. 
        The same model architecture and training parameters will be used for all experiments to ensure fair comparison.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Visualization and Interpretability:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
          Visualization will be used to show which parts of the image the model focuses on when predicting diseases. 
          This helps check whether the model is paying attention to the actual diseased areas of the leaf instead of the background.
