Please see <a href="http://vision.cs.utexas.edu/projects/adapted_attributes/">this</a> for an example of how to lay out the various details of your project. You may need to provide more details than this, because you will not be submitting an associated paper to accompany the webpage. So the page should be self-contained.

<h3>Abstract</h3>

One or two sentences on the motivation behind the problem you are solving. One or two sentences describing the approach you took. One or two sentences on the main result you obtained.
<p>
This project focuses on improving plant disease detection through enhanced image preprocessing techniques. 
Instead of building a new disease classification model, the goal is to test whether applying computer vision methods—such as color space transformation, 
noise reduction, edge enhancement, and histogram equalization—can improve the accuracy of existing deep learning models. The team will analyze how different 
preprocessing approaches affect the model's ability to recognize leaf disease patterns. By comparing results before and after applying these techniques, 
the project aims to show how proper preprocessing can lead to better computer vision performance and more reliable plant disease detection.

<!-- Introduction -->
<h3>Introduction</h3>
Motivation behind the problem you are solving, what applications it has, any brief background on the particular domain you are working in (if not regular RBG photographs), etc. If you are using a new way to solve an existing problem, briefly mention and describe the existing approaches and tell us how your approach is new.
<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>
The Plant Disease Detection project aims to build upon existing plant disease  detection systems by exploring and implementing computer vision 
techniques to improve accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Previous work in this area has successfully demonstrated the use of CNNs to 
classify plant diseases from leaf images. However, challenges such as variations in lighting, background noise, image quality, and class 
imbalance still limit real-world performance.
</p>

<p>
The goal of this project is to evaluate and enhance existing models through improved preprocessing, feature extraction, and model optimization 
techniques. Specifically, we will apply and compare methods such as image segmentation, data augmentation, edge detection, color space transformation, 
and feature enhancement filters to determine which approaches lead to the most accurate and reliable disease classification results.

<!-- Approach -->
<h3>Approach</h3>
Describe very clearly and systematically your approach to solve the problem. Tell us exactly what existing implementations you used to build your system. Tell us what obstacles you faced and how you addressed them. Justify any design choices or judgment calls you made in your approach.

<!-- Results -->
<h3>Experiments and results</h3>
Provide details about the experimental set up (number of images/videos, number of datasets you experimented with, train/test split if you used machine learning algorithms, etc.). Describe the evaluation metrics you used to evaluate how well your approach is working. Include clear figures and tables, as well as illustrative qualitative examples if appropriate. Be sure to include obvious baselines to see if your approach is doing better than a naive approach (e.g. for classification accuracy, how well would a classifier do that made random decisions?). Also discuss any parameters of your algorithms, and tell us how you set the values of those parameters. You can also show us how the performance varies as you change those parameter values. Be sure to discuss any trends you see in your results, and explain why these trends make sense. Are the results as expected? Why?

<!-- Plans -->
<h3>Plans for Experimantation</h3>
<p>
The team will begin the project by collecting or selecting an existing dataset that contains various plant leaf images, 
including both healthy and diseased samples. The main focus will not be on building a new dataset but on improving how images 
are prepared before being used for training and testing. The experiments will compare the performance of a standard deep learning model when trained 
on raw images versus images processed with different computer vision techniques.

<ol>
  <li><strong>Image Preprocessing:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Color space transformations to test how color representation affects feature visibility.
      </li>
      <li>
        Noise reduction using Gaussian blur or median filtering.
      </li>
      <li>
        Histogram equalization to enhance contrast and make disease spots more visible
      </li>
      <li>
        Edge enhancement using filters like Sobel or Laplacian operators.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Feature Extraction:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The processed images will be fed into a pre-trained deep learning model (such as a CNN) to measure how preprocessing affects accuracy and generalization. 
        The same model architecture and training parameters will be used for all experiments to ensure fair comparison.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Visualization and Interpretability:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
          Visualization will be used to show which parts of the image the model focuses on when predicting diseases. 
          This helps check whether the model is paying attention to the actual diseased areas of the leaf instead of the background.
