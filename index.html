<!-- Goal -->
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
This project focuses on improving plant disease detection through enhanced image preprocessing techniques. 
Instead of building a new disease classification model, the goal is to test whether applying computer vision methods—such as color space transformation, 
noise reduction, edge enhancement, and histogram equalization—can improve the accuracy of existing deep learning models. The team will analyze how different 
preprocessing approaches affect the model’s ability to recognize leaf disease patterns. By comparing results before and after applying these techniques, 
the project aims to show how proper preprocessing can lead to better computer vision performance and more reliable plant disease detection.

<!-- Introduction -->
<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>
The Plant Disease Detection project aims to build upon existing plant disease  detection systems by exploring and implementing computer vision 
techniques to improve accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Previous work in this area has successfully demonstrated the use of CNNs to 
classify plant diseases from leaf images. However, challenges such as variations in lighting, background noise, image quality, and class 
imbalance still limit real-world performance.
</p>

<p>
The goal of this project is to evaluate and enhance existing models through improved preprocessing, feature extraction, and model optimization 
techniques. Specifically, we will apply and compare methods such as image segmentation, data augmentation, edge detection, color space transformation, 
and feature enhancement filters to determine which approaches lead to the most accurate and reliable disease classification results.
</p>

<!-- Approach -->
<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>
  The team will build on an existing plant disease detection model that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
  for image classification. Instead of creating a new model, the focus will be on improving how the images are 
  preprocessed before training.
</p>
<p>
  Two training pipelines will be used: one with raw images as the baseline, and another with images processed
   using computer vision techniques such as color space transformation, Gaussian blur, Sobel and Laplacian 
   edge detection, and histogram equalization. The same CNN architecture will be used for both to ensure a fair
    comparison.
</p>
<p>
  The goal is to find out which preprocessing steps improve the model's accuracy and reliability. 
  The main challenge will be adjusting these methods to enhance disease features without distorting the image.
  Visualization tools like Grad-CAM will be used to confirm whether preprocessing helps the model focus on 
  the correct diseased areas.
</p>

<!-- Plans -->
<h3>Plans for Experimantation</h3>
<p>
  The team will begin the project by using two publicly available datasets found through Kaggle: PlantVillage 
  and New Plant Diseases Dataset. Both datasets contain labeled RGB images of healthy and diseased crop leaves
  across multiple plant species. Each dataset has around 87,000 images categorized into 38 different classes, 
  divided into 80% training and 20% validation sets. Both datasets were created through offline augmentation 
  from the original PlantVillage dataset, ensuring balanced class representation and good variety in lighting 
  and leaf position. A separate set of 33 test images is also provided for final evaluation.
</p>
<p>
  These datasets are well-suited for plant disease classification tasks and will serve as the foundation for 
  testing how different preprocessing techniques affect deep learning performance. The datasets already provide
  sufficient diversity in plant type, health condition, and image quality.
</p>
<p>
  The team will build on an existing implementation from Kaggle titled “Plant Disease Classification - ResNet (99.2%)” 
  by Samir Bhattarai, which uses a ResNet-9 architecture trained in PyTorch. This notebook demonstrates 
  how a convolutional neural network can achieve high accuracy on the PlantVillage dataset. We will use 
  this code as our baseline model and compare its performance to our own modified pipeline that includes
  new preprocessing methods.
</p>
<p>
  All preprocessing and experiment scripts will be written by the team using Python and OpenCV for image 
  processing. The model training and evaluation will be done using PyTorch, and experiments will run on Google 
  Colab, local system, or VT Advanced Research Center (ARC). We will record training accuracy, validation accuracy, loss curves, 
  and visualizations for analysis.

      <li>
        The team expects that adding preprocessing techniques will lead to improved accuracy and more 
        consistent predictions compared to the baseline ResNet-9 model trained on raw images. 
        Visualization results are expected to show that enhanced preprocessing helps the model 
        focus on diseased areas more accurately. However, it is uncertain which individual techniques 
        will have the greatest effect, or whether combining multiple methods will cause
        over-enhancement that reduces performance.

      </li>
      <li>
        Visualizations show better focus on diseased leaf areas.

      <li>
        The experiments clearly demonstrate that computer vision-based preprocessing can improve model 
        reliability and overall performance in plant disease detection.
